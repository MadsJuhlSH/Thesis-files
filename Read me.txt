This txt-file will explain what the different files in this folder is used for.

When using the files in this folder, will a few steps be required to do before hand.
First: Download some data for Rucio.
Second: Create Ntuples, the files I have for this are found in: /groups/hep/madsj/work/ntupleproduction
There should be some installation guide in /groups/hep/madsj/
Third: Create hdf5 files from the ntuples. I got mine in hdf5Prod/

My files start here: 

Fourth: After creating the Hdf5 files, I make some selections - the files which end in "Hdf5.py"
These files are both used in reconstruction and training. I'll assume you'll need to make some models first.
Fifth: Before the models are created, make some reweighed data.
Sixth: Train and test the models.
Seventh: Reconstruct the models.


Selection:
DATA_ZllgHdf5.py: Selects Z->llg events in data. Can't apply signal/background tag.
ggHdf5.py: Selects H->gamma gamma events in MC.
HllgHdf5.py: Selects H->Z(ll) gamma events. Looks like an old version
LeptonHdf5: Selects single leptons e and mu.
PhotonHdf5.py: Selects single photons.
ZllgHdf5.py: Selects Z->ll gamma events.
ZllHdf5.py: Selects Z->ll events.

Reweighing:
Reweight.py: Reweighs the data files, should be done before training.

Training and testing:
LGBM_train.py: Training and validation of models
LGBM_predict.py: Testing of models
Please make sure that the models have the same variables in LGBM_train.py, LGBM_predict.py and returnLGBMScores.py. 

Reconstruction:
Compare_LGBM_ATLAS.py: Applies models and comparing to cuts made by ATLAS, quite important once the models have been created

Misc:
Compare_2_rocs.py: Plotting the ROC curves for multiple models, for comparison. Fluff
Compare_2_rocs.py: Plotting Roc Curves for multiple models. Fluff
Datafit.py: Havn't gotten this to work yet. It fits the distributions, heavily based on codes from SDA.
muoGamPredict.py: SDA fitting file
peakfit.py: SDA fitting file
phoEtplot.py: Plotting the et for different part types (photon files)
plotscores.py: Plotting the different LGBM scores for the models set up for llgamma interactions.
returnLGBMScores.py: Returns the LGBM scores for a model.
Shapplot.py: Plots SHAP values, for given models.
Troels_School_Project.py: Selects H->gamma gamma interactions and calculates their isolation and identification values using my models. For a high school project for Troels
Utils: Various functions used in the scripts.
Weightplots.py: Plotting the weights - so a retraining of the Reweight.py file wont be needed.
Zllg_Compare_PidIso.py: Comparison between PID and ISO model.
Zplotvar.py: Plots all variables in a h5 file.
LGBM_sel_analysis.py: Compares signal and background for some of the results from LGBM:
