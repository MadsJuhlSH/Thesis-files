So for the thesis I will need:
Zeegam and Zmumugam
Gamma+jet
H->Zgamma 
H-> gam*gam
H->gamgam

For Zeegam:
I think I will need Iso/Pid for Electrons and photons? 
Found that for electrons in Zee_v1
So need to figure out how to do for photons

For Zmumugam: 
Will most likely need the same for muons and photons
Need to figure out how to do it for muons
Photons can use same results as from eegam?

Rest: 
Not sure, talk to Troels.
